# Serverless Google Cloud Sample Apps

**TODO**: update the links to the public docs once those are available.

This repository contains sample apps for various serverless Googl Cloud

documentation to correctly set up
[Datadog](https://docs-staging.datadoghq.com/aleksandr.pasechnik/serverless-gcp-docs-refresh/serverless/google_cloud)
instrumentation for your serverless applications.
